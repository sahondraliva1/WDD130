               During many celebrations, the host offers food both as a gesture and reflex action. Itâ€™s a gesture of love shown to people we care about whether on a sunny Sunday afternoon, at a wedding, or really during any sort of event. Itâ€™s also a physiological response to the mood. Naturally, certain mental states just make you want to eat something, both happy and sad. Food is also an expression of who we are. We associate certain types of food with certain cultures and religions. <a href="https://www.cateringbymichaels.com/why-food-celebration-are-inexorably-tied-together/">https://www.cateringbymichaels.com/why-food-celebration-are-inexorably-tied-together/</a> </p>
